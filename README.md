# Medical_Testing_Web_App

• Devised an MVC- based web application with Ruby-On-Rails, for implementing an automated order management and report generation system, within a medical testing facility. Implemented the backend database functionality of the system through MySQL.

• Engineered the system to allow for efficient user signup, database access control and system administration through multiple roles within the system (Admins, Doctors, Nurses, & Patients), by utilizing Angular JS, for building dedicated role- based dashboards, with customized views, functionality and access rights. 


To set up the application and for it to work, set up MYSQL with a user labu_root, and password - Mexico@123. Make sure the database's name is - labu_webapp.
